# TODO

## Fix
- [ ] hidesig
- [ ] Auto-write to buffer implementation. Or decide to ditch
- [ ] What is going on with ruby indentation. Does this work in nvim 0.11

## Possible Additions

- [ ] Lazygit integration
- [ ] Git delta, integrate with gh dash 
  - [ ] There's this diffnav git delta extenstion. Not sure how it would look in lazygit but probs good for gh dash


## To Remove

- Big files workaround for treesitter, use folke snacks
  - New neovim version has fixed this I think
- Mini statusline workaround for recording macros
  - This might need to stick around. Or replace mini statusline

## Not Sure On

- Octo, worth the effort?
  - No, replaced with gh dash
- Gitsigns replacement?
  - Don't miss gitsigns ATM
